# List of Annotations

| Annotation               | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `@SpringBootApplication` | Indicates a configuration class that declares one or more `@Bean` methods and also triggers auto-configuration and component scanning. |
| `@RestController`        | Combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody` to simplify the creation of RESTful web services. |
| `@RequestMapping`        | Provides routing information and is used to map web requests to specific handler classes or methods. |
| `@GetMapping`            | A composed annotation that acts as a shortcut for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)`. |
| `@PostMapping`           | A composed annotation that acts as a shortcut for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)`. |
| `@PutMapping`            | A composed annotation that acts as a shortcut for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.PUT)`. |
| `@DeleteMapping`         | A composed annotation that acts as a shortcut for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.DELETE)`. |
| `@PatchMapping`          | A composed annotation that acts as a shortcut for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.PATCH)`. |
| `@Autowired`             | Marks a constructor, field, setter method, or config method as to be autowired by Spring's dependency injection facilities. |
| `@Component`             | Indicates that an annotated class is a "component". Such classes are considered as candidates for auto-detection when using annotation-based configuration and classpath scanning. |
| `@Service`               | Indicates that an annotated class is a "Service" (e.g., a business service facade). |
| `@Repository`            | Indicates that an annotated class is a "Repository" (e.g., a Data Access Object or DAO). |
| `@Configuration`         | Indicates that a class declares one or more `@Bean` methods and may be processed by the Spring container to generate bean definitions and service requests for those beans at runtime. |
| `@Bean`                  | Indicates that a method produces a bean to be managed by the Spring container. |
| `@Value`                 | Indicates a default value expression for the annotated element. |
| `@PropertySource`        | Provides a convenient and declarative mechanism for adding a `PropertySource` to Spring's Environment. |
| `@EnableAutoConfiguration` | Enables Spring Boot’s auto-configuration mechanism. |
